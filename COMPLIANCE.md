# Compliance & Ethics

This project is intended for research and educational purposes. To ensure that the Texas Hold’em ML Bot is developed and used responsibly, all contributors must adhere to the following guidelines:

## Data Sources

- **Play‑money or synthetic only:** Use only play‑money hand histories, synthetic data, or public datasets that you have explicit permission to use. Do not scrape or use hand histories from real‑money platforms or services that prohibit automated play.
- **Documentation of sources:** Record the origin of all datasets used in `data/raw` in this file, including links, licenses, and any usage restrictions.

## Usage Restrictions

- **No real‑money deployment:** The bot must not be used on real‑money poker sites or any platform that forbids automated play. This includes, but is not limited to, online casinos and gambling applications.
- **Research and education:** The bot may be used for personal learning, academic research, and demonstration purposes. Any public demonstrations must make it clear that no real money is being wagered.

## Licensing and Attribution

- Respect the licenses of third‑party libraries and data. Include appropriate attributions where required.
- Ensure that any derived work complies with the original data license terms.

## Reporting Compliance Issues

If you become aware of any violation of these guidelines or misuse of the bot, please report it to the project maintainers. The project maintainers reserve the right to remove data or contributions that violate these guidelines.
